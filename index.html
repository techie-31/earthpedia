            The earth is the third planet from the sun. It is the only known planet in the solarsystem
            with life on it because it has all the favorable condition for the existence of life.
            Reflected light from the earth when seen from the space is seen as blue or bluish-green hence it is named as
            Blue Planet.</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            The temperature on the earth on an average varies from 15<sup>o</sup>C to 55<sup>o</sup>C making it most
            suitable for life to exist.
            It is enveloped in an atmosphere of gases, which includes mainly oxygen, carbon dioxide,
            and nitrogen it has own natural satellite called Moon. The atmosphere of this planet extends up to 800km.

                The earth atmosphere is divided into layers according to major changes in temperature, the five
                concentric layers
                are:
                <b>Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere and Exosphere.</b>

            <dt><b>Troposphere</b></dt><br>
            <dd>The troposphere is the lowest region in the earth’s atmosphere. On the earth it goes from ground or
                water level
                up to about 11 miles high.
                The weather and clouds occur in the troposphere. In the troposphere, the temperature generally decreases
                as
                attitude increases.
                The troposphere contains 75% of the gases in the atmosphere. This is where you live and where weather
                occurs. </dd><br>
            <dt><b>Stratospher</b></dt><br>
            <dd>
                The stratosphere is characterized by a slight temperature increase with attitude and the absence of
                clouds.
                The stratosphere extends between 11 and 31 miles above the earth’s surface.
                This layer absorbs a lot of UV solar energy. Only the highest clouds are in the lower stratosphere
                . Ozone acts as a shield for the earth’s surface. It absorbs UV radiation from the sun. This causes a
                temperature increase in the upper part of the layer.
            </dd><br>
            <dt><b>Mesosphere</b></dt><br>
            <dd>
                The mesosphere is characterized by temperature that quickly decreases as height increases. The
                mesosphere
                extends from between 31 and 50 miles
                above the earth’s surface. The temperature drops in this layer to about 100<sup>o</sup>C. This is the
                coldest
                region of the atmosphere. This layer protects the earth
                from meteoroids. They burn up in this area.
            </dd><br>
            <dt><b>Thermosphere</b></dt><br>
            <dd>
                In the thermosphere, temperature increases with attitude. The thermosphere means ‘heat sphere’. The
                temperature
                is very high in this layer because UV radiation is turned into heat.
                Temperature often reaches 2000<sup>o</sup>C or more.
            </dd><br>
            <dt><b>Exosphere</b></dt><br>
            <dd>
                The exosphere is the outermost layer of the earth’s atmosphere. The exosphere goes from about 400 miles
                high to
                about 800 miles. The lower
                boundary of the exosphere is called the critical level of escape, where atmospheric pressure is very low
                and the
                temperature is very low. The air is very
                thin here. This is the area where satellites orbit the earth.

                layers that

            <dt>Crust</dt><br>
            <dd>The outermost layer (where we live) of the earth is called the crust. It is coldest layer of the earth.
                It
                consists of rocks like granite, basalt etc. The thickness is around 0-60km.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Mantle</dt><br>
            <dd>Mantle is the widest section of the earth. Its thickness is approximately 2,900 km. The mantle is mainly
                made up
                of semi-molten rock known as
                magma. The rock is hard in upper part of the mantle but lower down the rock is softer and begins to
                melt. Its
                temperature varies between 1600<sup>o</sup>F at the
                upper part to 4000<sup>o</sup>F near the bottom.</dd> <br>
            <dt>Core</dt><br>
            <dd>The innermost layer of the earth is called core. It is the center of the earth. It is the hottest part
                of the
                earth. It is further divided into an<u> Inner core</u> and <u>Outer core</u>.</dd>
        </dl><br>
        <p>
            <b><i>Outer core: -</i></b> The outer core of earth is similar to a very hot ball of metals, whose
            temperature
            is around 4000<sup>o</sup>F to 9000<sup>o</sup>F. It is so hot
            that the metals inside are all liquid. The outer core is around 1800 miles under the crust and is
            approximately
            1400 miles thick. It is composed of metals
            such as iron and nickel. The outer core surrounds the inner core. <br><br>
            <b><i>Inner core: - </i></b> It is the center and the hottest layer of the earth. The inner core is
            solid and
            made up of iron and nickel with temperature up to
            5,500<sup>o</sup>C. Due to its immense heat energy, the inner core is more like the engine room of the
            earth.
            The inner core has pressures and temperatures
            so high that the metals are squeezed together and not able to move like a liquid but are forced to vibrate
            instead of solid.
